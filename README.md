MONSTERS DOM

- This is a fun project that allows you to learn how to simply access the dom using JS

- Fetured are some of my favorite monsters that you can learn and see the differences between them by switching to the different tabs above each monster

- Also if you want to copy and paste the css and html but leave the js and use this as a learning tool to find out how you can access the DOM in order to swtotch back and fourth between tabs

- COPY AND PASTE CSS AND HTML

- DO NOT USE JS UNTIL YOU'VE TRIED IT YOURSELF FIRST
